## Introduction

In this project, we delve into the statistical analysis and correlation insights of essential environmental indicators. These indicators include CO2 emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel energy consumption (% of total), and electricity production from oil sources (% of total). By employing Python programming and data analysis techniques, we aim to comprehend the interrelationships between these factors and their implications for environmental sustainability and energy planning.

The primary goals of this project are as follows:
- **Data Acquisition**: We gather data from the World Bank related to CO2 emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel energy consumption, and oil-based electricity production.
- **Data Cleaning**: We preprocess the data by eliminating missing values and irrelevant columns to ensure the dataset's integrity.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Using statistical methods like mean, standard deviation, and summary statistics, we explore the key characteristics and trends of the environmental indicators.
- **Correlation Analysis**: We investigate the strength and direction of relationships between different indicators through correlation analysis.
- **Visualization**: Through line graphs, bar graphs, and pie charts, we visually represent the data to facilitate understanding and identify patterns.

## Explanation

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: We download CSV files from the World Bank and perform cleaning operations to prepare the data for analysis.

2. **Statistical Analysis**: We utilize statistical measures to gain insights into the data's characteristics, such as mean, standard deviation, and summary statistics.

3. **Correlation Analysis**: By calculating correlation values, we determine the strength and direction of relationships between indicators, enabling us to understand how they are interconnected.

4. **Visualization**: Through line graphs, bar graphs, and pie charts, we present the data in a visually appealing manner, aiding in identifying trends and patterns.

5. **Code Implementation**: We use Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, and scipy for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Interpretation of the Results

We interpret the results through various visualizations and statistics:

- ![Figure 1](images/figure1.png): This line graph compares CO2 emissions and total greenhouse gas emissions over time, highlighting their trends and variations.

- ![Figure 2](images/figure2.png): A pie chart illustrates the proportion of total greenhouse gas emissions contributed by CO2 emissions, providing insights into their relative significance.

- ![Figure 3](images/figure3.png): This bar graph compares fossil fuel energy consumption (% of total) with electricity production from oil sources (% of total) over the years, facilitating a visual comparison.

## Conclusion

The analysis of environmental data demonstrates significant correlations between CO2 emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel energy consumption, and oil-based electricity production. These findings underscore the importance of considering environmental impact in energy planning. Leveraging the World Bank's reliable data and Python programming, our analysis contributes to understanding these relationships and supports sustainable energy strategies.
